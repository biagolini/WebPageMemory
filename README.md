## How to Play

The Memory game consists of a 4x4 grid containing 8 pairs of cards with matching values. The goal of the game is to find and match all pairs of cards. At the beginning of the game, all cards are placed face down. Players take turns flipping two cards face up. If the flipped cards have the same value, they are matched and remain face up. If the flipped cards have different values, they are flipped back face down after a short delay. The game is won when all pairs are matched.
